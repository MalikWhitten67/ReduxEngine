# ReduxEngine
A performant css and html game engine


# Why?

Canvas truly sucks and I believe the future of 2d web games should move to element based CSS manipulation.CSS has enough capabilities of both 2d and 3d in which is sufficient enough for a full blown engine.

# Installation

```html
<script src="/path/to/Redux.js">
```

# Usage 

```js
import { Scene, Camera, Entity, ReduxEngine } from 'ReduxEngine'
```
